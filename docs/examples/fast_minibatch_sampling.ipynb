    "# Fast minibatch sampling\n",

    "In this example, we show how to create a fast minibatch generator, which is typically used in Machine Learning to feed a training routine.\n",
    "It is not the intent of SeqTools to supplant specialized libraries such as tensorflow's [data module](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets) or [torch.utils.Dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html), but these might lack simplicity and flexibility for certain usages.\n",
    "Besides, it is absolutly possible to use seqtools to provide the inputs for these modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: As a general guideline, special care should be taken when using worker based functions along with these libraries.\n",
    "User are advised to become familiar with the behaviour of Python [threads](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) and [processes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) before using them.\n",

    "## Data samples\n",
